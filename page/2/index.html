<h3>The Shell</h3>

<p>There are scores, if not hundreds of books on the UNIX shell and related tools.<br>We have enjoyed LINUX 101 Hacks by Natarajan. It introduces<br>these tools through useful hacks, such as the use of find<br>to find all files that have not been modified in the past 100 days<br>and are larger than 100~megabytes in size, sorting the password file on the third field, etc.</p>
<ol><br><li>  Write a regular expression for identifying social security numbers in a file.<br></li><li>  Write a command that prints out lines in a text file which contain the<br>strings foo and bar in any order.<br></li><li>  Write a command which replaces every occurrence of a foo followed by a bar (with<br>possibly some other characters in between) by widget.<br></li><li>  Given a text file with two columns of integers, i.e., two integers encoded in ASCII per line, write a filter which sorts lines in the file by the second integer.<br></li><li>  How would you take two documents in PDF and create a new document which consists of the pages of the two original documents interleaved in order?<br></li><li>  How would you write a program which checks every hour if a network connection is up?<br></li><li>  How would you write a program which checks the price of a Nikon D5300 DLSR each day on amazon.com?<br></li></ol>

		<p>Our book is focused on questions that entail writing programs. You may be asked<br>questions related to general programming practices, which are conceptual and/or<br>knowledge-based, and do not require writing a program. (The extent to which<br>you are asked such questions depends on the company, your experience, the job, etc.)</p>
<p>Such questions tend to be narrow, and as such are not appropriate for our book.<br>We have begun the process of collecting representative questions, which you can see below. </p>

<p>We have also put together a small list of <a href="!--￼4--">warm up</a> exercises that are appropriate<br>for someone who is a little rusty.</p>

		<h3>Core language</h3>

<ol><br><li> What are the types in C, Java, C++, and Perl?  How many bits does it take<br>to represent the basic types?<br></li><li> What do floating point numbers look like in<br>memory? Specifically, how many bits are there in a double and<br>what sequence to the bits appear in?<br></li><li> What is twos-complement notation?<br></li><li> How would you implement a bit array class?<br></li><li> Does the check x == x + 1 always return false for integer x?<br></li><li> What does a C struct look like in memory?  What does a C++<br>object look like in memory? What does a Java object look like in<br>memory?<br></li><li> What is the difference between an interpreted and a compiled language?<br></li><li> What is garbage collection?<br></li><li> How would you determine if call stack grows up or down relative<br>to memory addresses?<br></li><li> Give an example of a memory leak in Java.<br></li><li> What is tail recursion? How can it be removed automatically?<br></li><li> Is the natural recursive program for computing <i>n!</i> tail recursive?<br></li><li> Your manager reads an online article that says it is 10X faster to code in Python than in C++.

<h3>Libraries</h3>

<p>A programmer who regularly implements complex algorithms such as KMP<br>string matching or the Dijkstra shortest path computation quickly<br>will not advance very far. Solutions to such problems are well-known and have<br>high quality, thoroughly tested, and debugged implementations, often<br>available as open source. Programmers should know and use these libraries.</p>
<ol><br><li>Give an example of a function which is in the C standard library.<br></li><li>Give an example of a commonly used function which is not in the C standard library.<br></li><li>What library would you use to determine the current date in Java?<br></li><li>What library would you use in Java if you had to implement a tinyurl service?<br></li><li>How does STL implement sets?<br></li><li>How does the library code compute trigonometric functions?<br></li><li>The strtok(char <em>s1, char </em>s2) function in the C standard library successively returns occurrences of the characters in s2 in string s1; it returns null if there are no more occurrences.<br></li><li>What makes this a dangerous function to use in a multithreaded program?<br></li></ol>

<h3>Programming language implementation</h3>

<ol><br><li> Give an example of a language which cannot be parsed by any computer.<br></li><li> What problems does dynamic linkage solve?

		<p>Debugging and testing are topics which are not usually the focus of university teaching.<br>We highly recommend The Practice of Programming by Kernighan and<br>Pike, which teaches much more than just writing code. Specifically, it covers testing,<br>debugging, portability, performance, and design alternatives.</p>

What can you do to make the code portable?<br></li><li> Write tests for implementation of an isupper() function.<br></li><li> Should you test private methods? Should you test one line methods?<br></li><li> If you find and fix an error by adding debug code, should you remove the debug code afterwards? Should you leave them in with a conditional compilation flag or with a run time flag?<br></li><li> What is a buffer overflow and how can hackers exploit it?<br></li><li> How can you use Valgrind to solve segfault problems?<br></li><li> How does Valgrind catch access uninitialized memory?<br></li></ol>

<p>The Ebook is identical to the printed copy.</p>
<p>Read our post <a href="2014/04/08/epi-features/">EPI in a nutshell</a> to get a broader overview of our book.</p>
<h4>Navigating the Ebook</h4>

<p>The typographic quality of iBooks and Kindle is unacceptable for a book like EPI that has sophisticated tables, drawings, equations, code, etc. (The input to these formats is HTML and the result is hideous - trust us, we’ve tried.)</p>
<p>Google Play is the only ebook format that will render EPI perfectly. The PDF we provide Google includes hyperlinks that allow you to click on problems in the table of contents, and referenced page numbers. However, despite multiple attempts on our part, Google Play strips these links out, making the ebook slower to navigate and search.</p>
<p>With Google Play you buy the book, try it out, and ask for a refund within a certain time period, and we encourage you to take advantage of this facility.</p>
<p></p><h4>Offline viewing<br>Some readers have had problems viewing the book offline. Here’s one reader’s experience, and his solution.<p></p>
<p>Last night when I disabled wifi, I noticed the book disappeared. Upon connecting to the wifi again I noticed the book eventually came back.  I thought I had synced all pages manually, but I noticed I was missing a few pages in the middle. Apparently the app won’t let you view the book offline until all pages are synced. I noted that during all these times the blue circle with checkmark was to the bottom right of the book as if the book is synced, but that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>I decided to sync those missing pages manually, but I noticed a weird thing after they were synced like a repetition of the same pages, like 65-68 couple of times in a row. I decided at that time to remove the book from downloads, and close the app altogether (double tap on home key and scroll up the app in the background). I thought about reinstalling the book app, but didn’t.</p>
<p>Then I started the download of the book again overnight…</p>
<p>This morning I noticed the blue checkmark, as if the book is synced.  Upon opening it, I saw that the pages weren’t synced either. This time I went to the beginning of the book, and scroll to the end (faster if you put the device in horizontal/landscape/2pages mode). Making sure that all pages are synced. Then did a couple of tests relaunching the app after: </p>
<ul>
<li>wifi disabled (app still in background)</li>
<li>wifi disabled, close app.</li>
<li>wifi disabled, rebooted ipad</li>
</ul>
<p>and they all worked and I was able to read the book offline this time.  Maybe the book was corrupted before ?</p>
<p>But I can tell that blue checkmark on the bottom right of the book doesn’t mean sync (at least not here)</p>

		<p><b>We wrote EPI for you!</b></p>
<p>EPI began as a Google Doc which we prepared for our friends who wanted to join companies<br>like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as hot startups.</p>
<p>Like you, they had talent, but were not familiar with the interviewing style<br>at these companies, and often failed to land their dream job.</p>
<p>For example, many of our friends had engineering and science degrees, or had been out of college for a while,<br>and were not prepared for data structures and algorithms interview questions.</p>
<p>EPI evens the playing field. Combined with your hard work, it will enable you<br>to interview successfully at the best companies.</p>

		<h2>Problem-driven approach</h2><br>EPI includes over 300 solved problems<br>representative of those asked at leading software companies.<br><p><br>With the exception of approximately 20 design problems, the<br>problems are designed to be codable in a 60 minute interview.<br></p><p><br>For many problems, at the end of its solution,<br>we describe a large number of variants.<br></p><p><br>We include a hints section, which consists of 1-2 sentence<br>suggestions, similar to what your interviewer will give you when you are stuck.<br></p><p><br><br><br></p><h2>The inside story</h2>

<p>All three of us successfully made it through the Google interview process, and went on to<br>work at Google, where, among other things, we interviewed candidates for our teams.</p>
<p></p><p><br>We have complementary backgrounds  (large company, startup, academia)<br>and have held multiple roles (individual contributor, tech lead, CTO, consultant, professor),<br>that gives us unparalleled insight into the job market.</p>
<p></p><p><br>In addition to Google, some of the other places we have worked at include<br>Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, Qualcomm, and Synopsys, as well as a number of start-ups.<br>We have studied and taught at leading universities in the US (Berkeley, Texas) and<br>internationally (IIT Kanpur, National Tsing Hua University).</p>
<p>

</p><h2>Study guide</h2>

<p>We specify subsets of problems to solve and to review on based on the amount of time you<br>can commit, ranging from a weekend hackathon (intense!), to an hour a day for a semester.</p>
<p>

</p><h2>Commitment to excellence</h2><br>We have used best-in-class practices in the development of EPI: LaTeX for document<br>preparation, GitHub for revision control, agile development, continuous integration, unit testing.<br><p><br></p><p><br>As a concrete example, we have close to 200 figures in our book. These<br>were prepared using the TikZ extensions to LaTeX, which allow us to programmatically<br>specify figures, leading to much clearer illustrations.<br></p><p><br><br></p><h2>Tested programs</h2><br>EPI solutions are mostly written in C++. (The programs illustrating concurrency<br>are in Java.)<br><p><br><br>We have developed Java equivalents to the C++ programs. Both<br>C++ and Java versions for all problems, including test cases,<br>available from Google Code and GitHub. See code link in the sidebar for details.<br><br></p><h2>Nontechnical aspects of interviewing</h2>

<p>In a seperate chapter, we present a set of 14 data structure, algorithm, and design patterns -<br>useful general problem solving techniques that you can apply when you are stumped. We<br>have suggestions on when and where to apply them, as well as examples illustrating their use.</p>
<p>

</p><p>We describe how to prepare for an interview, how to conduct yourself<br>during the interview, and what to do afterwards. This review covers the<br>technical (selecting variable names, memory management)<br>as well as nontechnical (what to wear, what not to say).<br>We present insights into<br>the different company cultures, and how it impacts how you need to present yourself.</p>
<p>

</p><p>We give a brief account of interviewing from the interviewer’s  perspective.<br>In addition to being useful to anyone interviewing, this is useful for any<br>engineer conducting an interview.</p>
